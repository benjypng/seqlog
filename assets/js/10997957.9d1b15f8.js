One of the more challenging aspects of using Logseq is that it is not very opinionated on how you should use its features. What I've discovered so far is that tags allow the user to define a consistent set of properties across blocks, but the user needs to determine how this feature can be useful. There are pre-defined tags such as ",(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"#Journal"})," for journal pages or ",(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"#Code"})," for code blocks and you can define properties for these tags. For example, if you navigate to the ",(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"#Code"})," tag page, you will be able to see a list of code blocks, and filter/organise by language. This is really useful personally, as I can quickly find different code snippets I've written before."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Once the DB version is sufficiently propagated, it will be interesting to see how the community fully leverages on this feature for their workflows."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h3,{id:"conclusion",children:"Conclusion"}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["From what I have observed so far, the decision to rewrite the app to use a proper database seems to have its benefits.
