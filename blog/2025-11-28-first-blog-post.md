title: Experience using Logseq in the last 2 weeks

I have been using Logseq DB for the past 2 weeks across 4 devices: 2 Macbooks, 1 iPad and 1 iPhone. Below are my findings:

### Stability

Sync has been much more stable across my devices, compared to the MD version. Behaviour is more consistent, and my data syncs more reliably. There are occassions where I've had to manually trigger a sync (using the `Sync Now` button) but other than that, I've not experienced any data loss so far.


### iOS/iPadOS app

The rewritten app (on Testflight) actually looks really good. It is much more stable and works more consistently. It is much more feature limited than the browser or the desktop versions, and I like this approach. It is a personal preference though; I don't expect to do full-blown editing on my mobile devices, and don't need the rest of the features. My priority is to be able to capture and retrieve information quickly. Both of which I am able to do now.

### Desktop version

As I'm actively working on porting over plugins to the DB version, I've been using the desktop app instead of the browser one. Once again, I've not had any problems so far. I keep Logseq open throghout the course of the day, and never faced any data loss issues so far.

### Tags vs Pages

In this area, I admit that I'm still trying to discover the best way to use the new tags. One of the more challenging aspects of using Logseq is that it is not very opinionated on how you should use its features. What I've discovered so far is that tags allow the user to define a consistent set of properties across blocks, but the user needs to determine how this feature can be useful. There are pre-defined tags such as `#Journal` for journal pages or `#Code` for code blocks and you can define properties for these tags. For example, if you navigate to the `#Code` tag page, you will be able to see a list of code blocks, and filter/organise by language. This is really useful personally, as I can quickly find different code snippets I've written before.

Once the DB version is sufficiently propagated, it will be interesting to see how the community fully leverages on this feature for their workflows.

### Conclusion

From what I have observed so far, the decision to rewrite the app to use a proper database seems to have its benefits. Users have been frustrated by how long it took, and that communication has not been very consistent. This is in spite of the very [active development](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/commits/master/) made by the dev team.

#### Author's Note

This is the first post of this blog. I hope to add to the discourse around Logseq as an active user and plugin developer, to provide a more accessible and transparent view of Logseq's progress. I am not a member of the development team.
