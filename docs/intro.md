# Introduction

This site hosts the documentation for the various [Logseq](https://logseq.com) plugins developed by [benjypng](https://github.com/benjypng?tab=repositories&q=logseq&type=&language=&sort=).

It also contains a [blog](/blog) to record my thoughts on the progress of Logseq's development.

### PRs

PRs for plugins are not accepted, unless it is for documentation in `README.md`.

### Issues

Please file them in the plugin's respective GitHub page. Please indicate if you are on the `MD` or `DB` version.
